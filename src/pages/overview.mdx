# OneNode DB Overview

OneNode DB is a **high-level database** specifically designed for Large Language Model (LLM) applications. It combines the power of multiple backend systems, including a NoSQL database, a vector database, and a blob database, while also incorporating efficient pipelines to cater to the specific needs of LLM-based projects.

By integrating these databases, OneNode DB provides a unified experience that allows users to seamlessly store, index, and retrieve structured, unstructured, and vector-based dataâ€”all within the same platform. This makes OneNode an ideal choice for modern AI-driven applications, especially those focused on natural language processing and complex data analysis.

## Components of OneNode DB

### 1. NoSQL Database
OneNode DB uses a NoSQL database to manage structured data and provide robust querying capabilities. The document model of this database allows users to work with data in a flexible and intuitive way.

### 2. Vector Database
For vector-based data, OneNode DB integrates with a high-performance vector database for efficient indexing and querying. This is particularly useful for applications that require similarity search, such as embeddings and recommendation systems.

### 3. Blob Storage
The blob database component of OneNode DB provides efficient storage for unstructured data like files, images, and other binary data. This complements the structured and vector data, making OneNode a comprehensive solution for all data types.

## Extended JSON Types
OneNode DB leverages **BSON (Binary JSON)** and introduces **OneNode Extended JSON** to facilitate seamless data indexing and querying. This enhanced JSON format allows users to work with extended data types, such as text embeddings, in a more natural way.

With **OneNode Extended JSON**, storing and managing complex data structures becomes easier, enabling the platform to support the sophisticated needs of LLM-based applications and AI projects.

## Key Features
- **Unified Database**: A combination of NoSQL, vector, and blob storage for versatile data handling.
- **Efficient Pipelines**: Built-in pipelines to manage data ingestion and processing tailored for LLM applications.
- **Extended JSON Support**: BSON and OneNode Extended JSON for enhanced data representation and manipulation.

## Future Development
Currently, OneNode DB does not provide SDKs. However, we are actively working on developing a **Python SDK** and a **JavaScript SDK**, which are planned for release in the summer of 2025. These SDKs will simplify integration and make it easier for developers to interact with the OneNode API.

Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to explore OneNode's existing capabilities through our detailed documentation and API references.
