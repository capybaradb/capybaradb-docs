# Delete

<LanguageToggle />

CapybaraDB supports deletion of documents using operations similar to MongoDB. You can delete one or multiple documents by specifying filters. This guide explains how to perform delete operations.

## Delete Operation

The `delete` operation is used to delete one or multiple documents in a collection based on a filter.

### Example Python Code for `delete`

Hereâ€™s how you can delete documents by applying a filter:

<LanguageContent lang="python">

```python filename="Python" showLineNumbers
# Filter to match the document(s) to delete
filter_criteria = {
    "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}

response = collection.delete(filter_criteria)
```

</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="typescript">

```typescript filename="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
// Filter to match the document(s) to delete
const filter_criteria = {
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
};

response = collection.delete(filter_criteria);
```

</LanguageContent>

### Delete Response

A successful delete operation will return a JSON response indicating the number of deleted documents:

```json
{
  "deleted_count": 1 // the count of deleted documents
}
```

## Parameters for Delete Operations

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **filter** | A query object to match the documents to delete. This works the same way as MongoDB filters, where you specify conditions to find the documents that need to be deleted. For more details, refer to the [official MongoDB documentation on query filters](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/#query-filter-documents). |
