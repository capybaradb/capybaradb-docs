CapybaraDB supports **MongoDB Extended JSON** and **EmbJSON** (CapybaraDB Extended JSON). This guide explains how to insert documents into CapybaraDB.

### Example: Python Code for `insert` Operation

Here's an example of how to insert documents using Python. You can insert a single document or multiple documents using the same endpoint. This example includes documents with Object IDs and **EmbJSON** fields:

```python copy filename="Python" showLineNumbers
from capybaradb import EmbText

doc = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "age": 30,
    "bio": EmbText("John is a software engineer with expertise in AI.")
}


# Sending the request
response = CapybaraDB.insert_one(doc)
```

### Insert Response

A successful insert operation will return the following JSON response:

```json copy filename="JSON" showLineNumbers
{
  "inserted_ids": [
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef90",
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef91",
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef92"
  ],
  "task_id": "abc123xyz" // or `null` if all processes were synchronously completed
}
```

The `inserted_ids` field contains the IDs of the successfully inserted documents. The `task_id` field will have a value if there is an asynchronous task related to EmbJSON. If `task_id` is `null`, it indicates that all processes, including embedding and indexing, were completed synchronously.

CapybaraDB supports **MongoDB Extended JSON** and **CapybaraDB Extended JSON** (EmbJSON). This guide explains how to insert documents into CapybaraDB using the `/document` endpoint via the REST API. The following examples demonstrate the use of MongoDB Extended JSON format for Object IDs and **EmbJSON** for embedding text.

### Example: TypeScript Code for `insert` Operation

Here's an example of how to insert documents using TypeScript with the `fetch` API. You can insert a single document or multiple documents using the same endpoint. This example includes documents with Object IDs and **EmbJSON** fields:

```typescript copy filename="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
import { EmbText } from "capybaradb";

const doc = {
  name: "John Doe",
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
  age: 30,
  bio: new EmbText("John is a software engineer with expertise in AI."),
};

response = collection.insert_one(doc);
```

### Insert Response

A successful insert operation will return the following JSON response:

```json copy filename="JSON" showLineNumbers
{
  "inserted_ids": [
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef90",
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef91",
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef92"
  ],
  "task_id": "abc123xyz" // or `null` if all processes were synchronously completed
}
```

The `inserted_ids` field contains the IDs of the successfully inserted documents. The `task_id` field will have a value if there is an asynchronous task related to EmbJSON. If `task_id` is `null`, it indicates that all processes, including embedding and indexing, were completed synchronously.
