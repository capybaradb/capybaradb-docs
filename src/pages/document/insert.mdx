# Insert

<LanguageToggle />

CapybaraDB supports **MongoDB Extended JSON** and **EmbJSON** (CapybaraDB Extended JSON). This guide explains how to insert documents into CapybaraDB.

### Example Code for `insert` Operation

<LanguageContent lang="python">

Here's an example of how to insert documents using Python. You can insert a single document or multiple documents using the same endpoint. This example includes documents with Object IDs and **EmbJSON** fields:

```python copy filename="Python" showLineNumbers
from capybaradb import EmbText

docs = [{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "johndoe@example.com",
    "age": 30,
    "bio": EmbText("John is a software engineer with expertise in AI.")
}]


# Sending the request
response = collection.insert(doc)
```

</LanguageContent>

<LanguageContent lang="typescript">

Here's an example of how to insert documents using TypeScript with the `fetch` API. You can insert a single document or multiple documents using the same endpoint. This example includes documents with Object IDs and **EmbJSON** fields:

```typescript copy filename="TypeScript" showLineNumbers
import { EmbText } from "capybaradb";

const docs = [
  {
    name: "John Doe",
    email: "johndoe@example.com",
    age: 30,
    bio: new EmbText("John is a software engineer with expertise in AI."),
  },
];

response = collection.insert(docs);
```

</LanguageContent>

### Insert Response

A successful insert operation will return the following JSON response:

```json copy filename="JSON" showLineNumbers
{
  "inserted_ids": [
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef90",
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef91",
    "64d2f8f01234abcd5678ef92"
  ],
  "task_id": "abc123xyz" // or `null` if all processes were synchronously completed
}
```

The `inserted_ids` field contains the IDs of the successfully inserted documents. The `task_id` field will have a value if there is an asynchronous task related to EmbJSON. If `task_id` is `null`, it indicates that all processes, including embedding and indexing, were completed synchronously.
