# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to OneNode DB! Follow these four simple steps to get started with our powerful API service. Whether you're inserting your first document or exploring our extended features, this guide will help you set up and make your first API request in no time.

## Step 1: Sign Up
First, you'll need to sign up for OneNode DB.

1. Head over to [OneNode DB Sign Up](https://db.onenode.ai).
2. After completing the sign-up process, log in and navigate to the dashboard by visiting `/dashboard`. This dashboard will be your main hub for managing databases, collections, and API keys.

## Step 2: Create an API Key
Once signed in, the next step is to create an API key for your project.

1. From the sidebar, navigate to the **API Key** page.
2. Click the button to create a new API key. You may optionally assign a name to your key, but it is not required.
3. Each API key is associated with a specific project under your organization.
4. **Important**: The API key will only be displayed once during creation. **Please make sure to store it securely**, as you won't be able to see it again after closing the modal.

## Step 3: Create a Collection
Next, you'll create a collection, which is where your data will be stored.

1. On the sidebar, locate the **Collection** tab. Click the **plus (+)** button to create a new collection.
2. Set both the **database name** and **collection name**. Once created, the new collection will appear under its respective database in the sidebar.
3. To proceed, click on the collection name to open its **Collection Page**. On this page, you will see the **Database ID**, which you will need for making API requests.

## Step 4: Make Your First API Request
You're now ready to make your first API call to store a document in your newly created collection.

### Base API Endpoint
The base API endpoint for each collection is structured as follows:
```
https://api.onenode.ai/db/{database_id}/collection/{collection_id}
```
Replace `{database_id}` and `{collection_id}` with the corresponding values you obtained earlier.

### Example: Insert a Document
Let's insert a document into the collection. You can do this using `curl` with the following command:

```sh
curl -X POST "{base_api_endpoint}/document" \
  -H "Api-Key: $ONENODE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": "7",
    "background": {"@embText": {"text": "Through the Looking-Glass follows Alice as she steps through a mirror into a fantastical world where everything is reversed, like a reflection. In this chess-themed land, she meets peculiar characters like the Red Queen, the White Queen, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and Humpty Dumpty. Alice navigates through a series of bizarre and whimsical encounters, eventually becoming a queen herself. In the end, she awakens from the dreamlike adventure back in her own world, unsure whether it was her dream or the Red King's."}}
  }'
```
In this example, we're inserting a document with some basic information about **Alice**. Notice the use of `@embText`â€”this is OneNode's **extended JSON type** that requires a specific structure to handle complex text embedding.

For more information on OneNode's extended JSON types, please refer to the [OneNode Extended JSON documentation](/data-types).
