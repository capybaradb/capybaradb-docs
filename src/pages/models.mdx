# Supported LLM Models for EmbJSON

CapybaraDB supports a variety of **embedding models** for use with **EmbJSON** data types. These models help convert text data into embeddings, enabling powerful semantic search capabilities with just a few configurations.

To specify an embedding model in your **EmbJSON** fields, use the **emb_model** parameter for text embeddings. CapybaraDB provides seamless integration with leading LLM providers, making it easy to get started.

## Embedding Models

These models are available for embedding text data in **EmbJSON** fields such as **EmbText**:

| Model                  | Provider |
| ---------------------- | -------- |
| text-embedding-3-small | OpenAI   |
| text-embedding-3-large | OpenAI   |
| ada v2                 | OpenAI   |

**CapybaraDB does not charge for LLM usage directly**. Instead, users pay the LLM providers via CapybaraDB, which facilitates the payment process for convenience. This allows you to leverage the best available models without worrying about hidden costs or extra fees from CapybaraDB.
