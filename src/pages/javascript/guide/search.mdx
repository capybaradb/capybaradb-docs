# Search

You can search items that have similar semantic meanings as your query using OneNode API. This is usufull especially when you want to create RAG (Retrieval Augumented Generation) applications. You can also use metadata filter to search only from specific group of items.

## Search items

You can search items either by natural language query or vector.

### Search by a natural language query

When you want to search items by natural language query, just add `query` value to the parameter. By default, OneNode optimizes query meaning that your query value will be rephrazed for the best vector search performance.

```javascript copy
// Define the filter.

const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
  query: "Where is Alice from?",
  filter: filter, // filter is optional
}).toString();

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.onenode.ai/v1/resource?${queryParams}`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${ONENODE_API_KEY}`,
    },
  }
);

/*
response:
[
  { id: "...", text: "...", embed_targets: ["text"] },
  { id: "...", text: "...", embed_targets: ["text"] },
]
*/
```

If you want to search by your original query without query optimization, you can add an optianl parameter `query_optimization=false`. In this way, you can have more control over what query should be used and get faster response from OneNode API.

```javascript copy
const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
  query: "Where is Alice from?",
  filter: filter, // filter is optional
}).toString();
```

### Search by a vector

You can also search by vector values using OneNode API. Just make sure the dimention of your vector value is the same as the model you chose. For example, `text-embedding-ada-002` has `1536` dementions meaning that your vector values must have exactly `1536` dementions. If you're unsure, we recommend using [Search by a natural language](##search-by-a-natural-language-query)

```javascript copy
// Define the filter.

const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
  query: "Alice's origin",
  filter: filter, // filter is optional
}).toString();

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.onenode.ai/v1/resource?${queryParams}`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${ONENODE_API_KEY}`,
    },
  }
);

/*
response:
[
  { id: "...", text: "...", embed_targets: ["text"] },
  { id: "...", text: "...", embed_targets: ["text"] },
]
```

Now, you've leaned how to search items based on semantic meanings using OneNode API.
