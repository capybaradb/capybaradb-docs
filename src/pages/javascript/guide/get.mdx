# Get

You can get a list of items using OneNode API that match filter criteria. This is quite useful when you want to get items with specific metadata. Note that get operation is different from [search operation](/developer/docs/javascript/guide/search) which returns items based on semantic similarities.

## Get items

OneNode API has built-in querying operation that returns content, metadata, vectors, or media data as you need. OneNode’s filtering query language is based on [MongoDB’s query and projection operators](https://docs.pinecone.io/guides/data/filter-with-metadata). OneNode currently supports a subset of those selectors.

Below is an example of getting one item that matches the specified user_name. Note that this is just an example and you can desing your data field as you like. Here we assume `user_name` is defined under `metadata`.

```javascript copy
// Define the filter.
const filter = { "metadata.user_name": "Alice" };

const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
  filter: filter,
}).toString();

const response = await fetch(
  `https://api.onenode.ai/v1/resource?${queryParams}`,
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: `Bearer ${ONENODE_API_KEY}`,
    },
  }
);

/*
response:
[
  { id: "...", text: "...", metadata: {user_name: "Alice", age: 25} embed_targets: ["text"] },
  { id: "...", text: "...", metadata: {user_name: "Alice", age: 25} embed_targets: ["text"] },
  ...
]
*/
```

Now you've got items that match your `filter` criteria.
