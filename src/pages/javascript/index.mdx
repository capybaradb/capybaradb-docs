## Introduction

You can interact with the API through HTTP requests from any language.

## Authentication

The OneNode API uses API keys for authentication. You can create your API keys at the developer dashboard.
**Remember that your API key is a secret!** Do not share it with others or expose it in any client-side code (browsers, apps). Production requests must be routed through your own backend server where your API key can be securely loaded from an environment variable or key management service.

All API requests should include your API key in an Authorization HTTP header as follows:

```bash copy
Authorization: Bearer ONENODE_API_KEY
```

## Organizations and projects (optional)

For users who belong to multiple organizations or are accessing their projects through their legacy user API key, you can pass a header to specify which organization and project is used for an API request.
To access the `Default project` in an organization, leave out the `OneNode-Project` header.

```sh copy
curl https://api.onenode.ai/v1/resource \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ONENODE_API_KEY" \
  -H "OneNode-Organization: org-Hl8MND6xdQe4s3ZwFApJWBcr" \
  -H "OneNode-Project: $PROJECT_ID"
```

## Making requests

You can paste the command below into your terminal to run your first API request. Make sure to replace `$ONENODE_API_KEY` with your secret API key.

```sh copy
curl https://api.onenode.ai/v1/resource \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $ONENODE_API_KEY" \
-d '{
   "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
   "content": Hello World!,
   "metadata": {"description": "This is test API call"},
   "embedding_fields": ["content", "metadata.description"]
 }'
```

This request queries the gpt-4o-mini model. You can use any [supported LLM models](/developer/docs/models) without having to get your own API keys from different LLM providers. For example, you can use OpenAI models via OneNode API only with your ONENODE_API_KEY. After successful API call, you'll recieve saved resource looks like this:

```json copy
{
   "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
   "content": Hello World!,
   "metadata": {"description": "This is test API call"},
   "embedding_fields": ["content", "metadata.description"]
 }
```

Now that you've saved your first resource.
